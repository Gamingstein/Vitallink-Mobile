# Welcome to VitalLink Mobile ðŸ‘‹

VitalLink Mobile is a standalone mobile application designed to provide healthcare professionals with real-time patient monitoring and advanced insights. Built using [Expo](https://expo.dev) and leveraging modern technologies like IoT, AI, and GraphQL, this app enables seamless access to patient data, empowering better decision-making and enhanced care delivery.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/): For testing with custom native code.
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/): To simulate the app on Android devices.
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/): To simulate the app on iOS devices.
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go): A lightweight sandbox for quick testing and development.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **src/app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) for intuitive navigation and structure.

## About the Project

VitalLink Mobile is a key component of the VitalLink ecosystem, designed specifically for mobile platforms to enhance healthcare delivery. It provides:

- **Real-time Patient Monitoring**: Track vital signs like heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and temperature in real-time, directly from IoT devices.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Generate personalized reports and actionable insights to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
- **Independent Functionality**: While it complements the [VitalLink Web Frontend](https://github.com/Gamingstein/Vitallink-frontend), the mobile app operates independently, offering a tailored experience for on-the-go healthcare providers.
- **User-Centric Design**: Features intuitive onboarding, secure authentication, and seamless navigation to ensure a smooth user experience.

The app is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend and maintain. It supports both light and dark themes, ensuring usability in various environments.

## Reset the Project

If you need a fresh start, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will archive the current code into the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory for new development.
